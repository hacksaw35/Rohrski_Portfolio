      I ask questions, remove barriers, and create products that help people get things done. 

My last project, <a href="http://signalkit.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Signal Kit" class="underline" >Signal Kit</a> was recently acquired by Parentsquare. Prior to that I worked on <a href="https://www.campus.co/" target="_blank" aria-label="Google Campus" class="underline"  >Google Campus</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git
" target="_blank" aria-label="Atlassian Git" class="underline" >Atlassian Git</a>. Currently, leading product design and user research at <a href="https://www.luckyorange.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Lucky Orange" class="underline" >Lucky Orange</a>. ✌️
