      Hi, I'm Dan. I ask questions, remove barriers, and create products that help people get things done. I find the sweet spot between peopleâ€™s needs and business needs, and burrito that up into a thoughtful experience. You can find me leading product design and user research at Lucky Orange in Kansas City.
